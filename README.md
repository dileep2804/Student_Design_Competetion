# Student_Design_Competetion
we secured 4th rank in SDC2020 held in MARWADI UNIVERSITY, RAJKOT, INDIA.
Built a semi-autonomous robot of size (50cm X 50cm X 50cm) which can build a tower from standard A4 sized pages 
without using any joining material such as adhesives or stapling pins etc. 
The maximum height achieved by the robot is close to 1.8 meters without extending any parts of the machine beyond 50 cm
Several mechanisms like 2d plotter, height-adjustable platform, Scotch-Yoke mechanism, rack, and pinion slider etc were deployed.
Electronic components included stepper motor, servo motor, and dc motors were run simultaneously usiing microcontroller in coordination to complete different tasks.
Aurdino IDE were extensively used for programming the microcontroller board for different mechanism.
